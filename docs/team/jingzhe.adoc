== PROJECT: ContactSails

---

== Overview

ContactSails is built upon AddressBook - Level 4. It is a desktop application used for people in sales. The users will benefit from the application through the features in Contact Sails.
 The user interacts with the application using Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: My major enhancement is the addition of a *person panel* in ContactSails.
** What it does: It allows the user to see contacts' information in a neater and more detailed manner.
** Justification: Sales people may want a better overview of their clients when making sales decisions. By introducing person panel in the application, this will aid the person in making better sales decisions by giving a better visual overview of the user through the size of the panel.
** Highlights: This enhancement also show the groups and preferences the client have. A profile picture could have been added but because the implementation is too challenging, it may be a possible feature only in the future.

* *Minor enhancement*: My minor enhacement is the addition of colours to groups and preferences.
** Credits: The suggested enhancement in CS2103T appendix A aided me in this.
