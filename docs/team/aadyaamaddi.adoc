== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *manage customer orders*.
** What it does: Orders can be added, edited, and deleted. A list of current orders can be viewed. Orders can also be marked as ongoing or fulfilled.
** Justification: For salespersons, this feature will be essential to have as they would want to keep track of what their customers are ordering and what they have ordered already. If customers have any issues regarding their orders, salespersons will be able to view all the relevant information in a single place.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* *Minor enhancement*: added *auto-complete functionality* for all commands.
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main/blob/master/collated/functional/amad-person.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/amad-person.md[Test code]]
