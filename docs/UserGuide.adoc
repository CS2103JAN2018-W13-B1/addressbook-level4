== Introduction

ContactSails is for users who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ContactSails can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

To set up and start using ContactSails, do the following:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `ContactSails.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The User Interface (UI) should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box (located right below Menu Bar) and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Commands also have alias words so you can execute the same commands in a quicker way.
.  Some example command aliases you can try:

* *`l`* : lists all contacts
* **`a`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
