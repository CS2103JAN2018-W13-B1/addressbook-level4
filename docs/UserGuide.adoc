== Introduction

ContactSails is for users who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ContactSails can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

To set up and start using ContactSails, do the following:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Commands also have alias words so you can execute the same commands in a quicker way.
.  Some example command aliases you can try:

* *`l`* : lists all contacts
* **`a`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`d`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : q

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

This section describes each command in ContactSails in detail.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[g/GROUP]...` `[pr/PREFERENCE]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `g/friend`, `g/friend g/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
