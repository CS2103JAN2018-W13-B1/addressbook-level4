== Introduction

ContactSails is a desktop application targeted at salespersons who want to manage their customer contacts, sales orders,
and calendar events in an efficient manner. +

This guide provides the necessary technical information for those
who might want to join our team as a software developer or a tester,
or for those who want to develop an entirely different product by using ContactSails as a base. +

The following points illustrate what information this guide provides:

1. Details about the software architecture and how each component of the application is designed. +
2. Implementation details of some noteworthy features in the application. +
3. Details about software testing, documentation, and dev ops.

== Setting up

This section will guide you in setting up the developer environment on your computer for coding and testing purposes.

=== Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following prerequisites for successfully setting up the developer environment:

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+

The Java JDK is a software development kit that includes a runtime environment and tools for developing, debugging, and
monitoring Java applications.
You can download it http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here].
+

[NOTE]
ContactSails will not work with earlier versions of Java 8, so ensure that you have installed the right version of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDEA
+

IntelliJ IDEA is a Java integrated development environment for developing computer software.
You can download the (free) community edition https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[here].
+

[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project on your computer

Follow these steps to set up the project on your computer:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.

.Forking and cloning the ContactSails repository from its Github page.
image::ForkAndClone.png[width="400" align="center"]

[start=2]
. Open IntelliJ. You should see the Welcome Screen (shown in the figure below).
[NOTE]
If you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first.

.IntelliJ's Welcome screen.
image::IntelliJWelcomeScreen.png[width="400" align="center"]

[start=3]
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle:
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file in the ContactSails repository directory and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings. You will now be directed to the `Import Project` window, as shown below.

.The 'Import Project' window.
image::ImportWindowFirstScreen.png[width="400" align="center"]

[start=8]
. Click `Next` repeatedly to import the project with the default settings until you reach the last window (this window will have a `Finish` button).
. Click `Finish` to finish importing the project.
. Open the `Terminal` and run the command `gradlew processResources` (run `./gradlew processResources` for Mac/Linux). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This generates all the resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Follow these steps to verify that the project has been setup correctly:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

This section provides information on the additional configurations that you need to setup before you can start writing code.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. +

To use the correct coding style, follow these steps:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order:

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main/blob/master/docs/UsingCheckstyle.adoc[UsingCheckstyle.adoc] document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main` repo), you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main/blob/master/docs/UsingTravis.adoc[UsingTravis.adoc] to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork see https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main/blob/master/docs/UsingCoveralls.adoc[UsingCoveralls.adoc].

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI see https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B1/main/blob/master/docs/UsingAppVeyor.adoc[UsingAppVeyor.adoc].

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

The following section provides information about the software architecture of ContactSails. It also illustrates the design of each component.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given below (Figure 1) explains the high-level design of the App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600" align="center"]

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

Given below is a quick overview of each item in the Architecture Diagram.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It does the following:

* At app launch: It is responsible for initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: It is responsible for shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes, `EventsCenter` and `LogsCenter`, play important roles at the architecture level.
Given below is a description of what each of those classes do:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

1. <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: UI is the user interface of the App.
2. <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Logic is the command executor.
3. <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Model holds the data of the App in-memory.
4. <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Storage reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

Each of the four components does the following:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see Figure 2 below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ (Figure 3) below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800" align="center"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The _Sequence Diagram_ (Figure 4) below shows how `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800" align="center"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections from 3.2 to 3.5 below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

The `UI` Component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
Figure 5 below shows the structure of the `UI` component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

*API* for the `UI` Component: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` Component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` Component does the following:

. Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
. Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

The `Logic` Component deals with how each command would be parsed and executed in an event-driven design.
Figure 6 below shows the structure of the `Logic` Component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

This diagram above (Figure 7) shows the finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>

*API* for the `Logic` Component:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The `Logic` Component does the following:

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the _Sequence Diagram_ (Figure 8) for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800" align="center"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

The `Model` Component handles the contacts, orders, and events in ContactSails and all their stored details in data structures.
These structures also provide APIs to create, read, update and delete the details of these objects.
Figure 9 below shows the structure of the `Model` Component.

.Structure of the `Model` Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

*API* for the `Model` Component: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` Component does the following:

. Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
. Stores the Address Book data.
. Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
. Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Order>` and `ObservableList<CalendarEntry>` similar to the `ObservableList<Person>` mentioned above.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

The `Storage` Component handles the storing of data in the address book on the local computer.
Figure 10 below shows the structure of the `Storage` Component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

*API* for the `Storage` Component: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` Component does the following:

. Saves `UserPref` objects in .json format and reads it back.
. Saves the Address Book data in .xml format and reads it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

This feature allows users to undo and redo certain commands executed in the current session.

==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. Figure 11 shows the inheritance diagram for commands.

.Inheritance Diagram for commands in `Logic` Component
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

As you can see from figure 11, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.UndoRedoStack before and after executing 1 Delete Command
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.UndoRedoStack before and after Executing 1 Add Command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.UndoRedoStack before and after executing Undo Command
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for executing Undo Command
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.UndoRedoStack before and after executing Clear Command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.UndoRedoStack before and after executing List Command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Execution Path when Undoable Commands
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650" align="center"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: It is hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: The overriding does not involve the template pattern, which is easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: This method is easy to implement.
** Cons: This may have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: This will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the application (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: The inclusion of all commands might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the application and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: A separate stack for undo and redo is easier for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: This requires dealing with commands that have already been undone, in which we must remember to skip these commands. This violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::personpanel[]
=== Person Panel
The `PersonPanel` replaces the previous `BrowserPanel`, and is called upon using the methods in `CenterPanel`.
`PersonPanel` will be used to display contact's information, groups and preferences depending on user's actions.

==== Layout Implementation
The specifications for the layout of PersonPanel is in `PersonPanel.fxml`. Figure 19 shows the visual layout of the `PersonPanel`.

.Visual layout of PersonPanel
image::PersonPanelLayout.png[width="800" align="center"]

Notably, the contact's group and preferences are coloured as these are important information to the user.
We plan to implement more features for v2.0, such as a profile picture for the contact.

==== Current Implementation
By utilising the `EventsCenter`, PersonPanel is able to display contact's particulars, its
groups and preferences when its respective `PersonCard` is selected.

The following 2 code snippets will show its implementation.

Code Snippet 1 : handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event)
[source,java]
----
public void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
    loadBlankPersonPage();
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
    selectedPersonCard = event.getNewSelection();
    person = selectedPersonCard.person;
    loadPersonPage(person);
}
----
Whenever a contact is selected, the event `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent` is triggered. Once the event is triggered,
the method will obtain its respective `PersonCard` variable and a `Person` variable, which
contains the information of the contact. The `person` variable will be passed
into the method `loadPersonPage(Person person)`, which is code snippet 2.

Code Snippet 2: loadPersonPage(Person person)
[source,java]
----
private void loadPersonPage(Person person) {
    name.setText(person.getName().fullName);
    phone.setText(person.getPhone().toString());
    address.setText(person.getAddress().toString());
    email.setText(person.getEmail().toString());
    person.getGroupTags().forEach(tag -> {
        Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);
        tagLabel.getStyleClass().add(PersonCard.getGroupTagColorStyleFor(tag.tagName));
        groups.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
    });
    person.getPreferenceTags().forEach(tag -> {
        Label tagLabel = new Label(tag.tagName);
        tagLabel.getStyleClass().add(PersonCard.getPrefTagColorStyleFor(tag.tagName));
        preferences.getChildren().add(tagLabel);
    });
    setIcons();
    setImageSizeForAllImages();
}
----
The `Person` variable that is passed into `loadPersonPage` will be used to extract the
contact's information for display. After which, the UI of the `PersonPanel` will be updated
accordingly to reflect the changes.

[NOTE]
No contact information will be displayed upon opening the application as no contact is selected.

To better illustrate the code snippets, the following is a high level sequence diagram when the user
selects a contact found in `PersonListPanel`.

.Sequence diagram for selection
image::SelectionPersonPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]
When a contact is selected using a mouse or a command in `PersonListPanel`, this will result in `EventsCenter`
returning a `Person` of the selected contact, which then displays the contact information in `PersonPanel`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Display of tags in PersonPanel (and PersonCard)
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tags are coloured randomly.
** Pros: It is easier to differentiate between tags through the colours.
** Cons: It may be confusing as tag colours will be changed for each new instance of the application.

* **Alternative 2:** Tags to be kept the same colour as intended.
** Pros: There is no work to be done.
** Cons: Users will take a longer time to differentiate the tags.

===== Aspect: Display of contact's information
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** It is to replace BrowserPanel with a PersonPanel which displays all information of the chosen contact.
** Pros: We can add more features into PersonPanel that the BrowserPanel is unable to achieve.
** Cons: PersonPanel will not be able to display web pages, for instance the contact's social media web page.

* **Alternative 2:** It is to keep the BrowserPanel and use HTML files to display contact's information.
** Pros: There isn't a need to modify the existing code but to edit the HTML files to display contact's information.
** Cons: It may take a long time to implement and there are other important issues.
// end::personpanel[]

// tag::ordermanagementintro[]
=== Order Management

Orders refer to the sales orders that are added by the salesperson to ContactSails.
These orders can be added to any particular person of the address book.
After being added, orders can be edited and deleted. Additionally, orders can be marked as `ongoing` and `done`.

==== Current Implementation

An `Order` is represented in the application as shown in the figure given below.
It contains the `OrderInformation`, `OrderStatus`, `Price`, `Quantity`, and `DeliveryDate` fields.

.UML Diagram for an Order object.
image::OrderUMLDiagram.png[width="300" align="center"]

`Order` objects are kept in-memory during an application session with the help of a `UniqueOrderList` object, whose UML diagram is given below.

.UML Diagram for UniqueOrderList.
image::UniqueOrderListUMLDiagram.png[width="300" align="center"]

The `UniqueOrderList` object ensures that ContactSails does not have any duplicate `Order` objects. This object is stored in the `ModelManager`.

The `ModelManager` utilises the `UniqueOrderList` object for order management related operations.
An example operation would be adding an order to ContactSails.
Given below is a high-level sequence diagram for this operation.

.High-Level Sequence Diagram for adding an order. Other operations follow the same high level sequence diagram.
image::HighLevelSequenceDiagramForOrderAdd.png[width="500" align="center"]

Operations on orders can be done using the `AddOrderCommand`, `EditOrderCommand`, `ChangeOrderStatusCommand`, and `DeleteOrderCommand` commands.
The class diagram given below shows how these commands are part of the `Logic` Component.

.UML Diagram showing order management related commands in the `Logic` component.
image::UMLDiagramOrderCommandsLogic.png[width="300" align="center"]

These commands are described in more detail in the sections below. +
// end::ordermanagementintro[]

// tag::addingorders[]
===== Adding Orders

The `AddOrderCommand` adds an order to list of orders in ContactSails.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for adding an order.

.Sequence Diagram for `AddOrderCommand`.
image::AddOrderSeqDiagram.png[width="600" align="center"]

The following snippet shows how the `AddOrderCommand#executeUndoableCommand()` method updates the `model` of the
application by adding `orderToAdd` to the list of orders in the application. Note that `orderToAdd` will
not be added if a duplicate order has already been added to the list of orders before.

[source,java]
----
public class AddOrderCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        try {
            model.addOrderToOrderList(orderToAdd);
        } catch (DuplicateOrderException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_ORDER_NOT_ADDED);
        }

        // ... display updated address book ...
    }
}
----

The order added will be displayed in the OrderListPanel in ContactSails.
// end::addingorders[]

// tag::editingorders[]
===== Editing Orders

The `EditOrderCommand` edits the `targetOrder` with the provided information which is specified by its `index`
in the last shown listing of orders. The order will be updated with the new values given by the user.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for editing an order.

.Sequence Diagram for `EditOrderCommand`.
image::EditOrderSeqDiagram.png[width="600" align="center"]

In the `EditOrderCommand` class, a new class called `EditOrderDescriptor` is defined to create objects
that will store the new values of the fields that need to be edited in the original order.
The `createEditedOrder()` method uses the `editOrderDescriptor` object to create the `editedOrder`
object.

The `executeUndoableCommand()` method uses this `editedOrder` object to update the `model` of the application.
The new order is now stored in ContactSails in the place of the old order.
// end::editingorders[]

// tag::changeorderstatus[]
===== Changing OrderStatus

The `ChangeOrderStatusCommand` changes the `OrderStatus` field of an `Order` object to either `ongoing` or `done`.
The `order` object is obtained by using its `index` in the last shown listing of orders.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for changing an order's status.

.Sequence Diagram for `ChangeOrderStatusCommand`.
image::ChangeOrderStatusSeqDiagram.png[width="600" align="center"]

On changing the order status of an order, the colour of the corresponding `OrderCard` in the `OrderListPanel` also changes.
This is done by simply removing the existing `CSS` styles associated with the `OrderCard`
and re-adding a new stylesheet with the appropriate colours to that `OrderCard`.
// end::changeorderstatus[]

// tag::deletingorders[]
===== Deleting Orders

The `DeleteOrderCommand` deletes the order specified by its `index` in the last shown listing of orders.
The figure below shows the sequence diagram for changing an order's status.

.Sequence Diagram for `DeleteOrderCommand`.
image::DeleteOrderSeqDiagram.png[width="600" align="center"]

The above method deletes `orderToDelete` from the `model` of the address book and the resulting list of orders is displayed.
// end::deletingorders[]

// tag::otherinfo-orders[]
===== Storing Orders

Storing orders in the application data file is very similar to that of storing persons.
The `XmlAdaptedOrder` class is used to convert the `Order` objects in the `model` to JAXB-friendly `XmlAdaptedOrder` objects
that can be stored in the `.xml` data file. When the application starts up, this class is also used to convert the `XmlAdaptedOrder` objects
into a `model`-friendly `Order` objects.

===== Displaying Orders In GUI

A single `Order` is displayed using an `OrderListCard`. The list of all orders in the address book is then displayed in a list
using the `OrderListPanel`, which contains an `OrderListView` of multiple `OrderListCards`.
// end::otherinfo-orders[]

// tag::designcons-orders[]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structures to support order operations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store a UniqueOrderList of orders containing orders of all persons in the application.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Additionally, all order management operations will be synchronised.
** Cons: Higher memory usage might affect the performance of the application.
* **Alternative 2:** Using an association class to store multiple references to the same order.
** Pros: Duplicate orders (with the same information except the person associated with it) will just be stored as a single order in memory.
If multiple persons have the same order, there will be multiple references to one Order object. This reduces memory usage.
** Cons: Harder to implement as updating or deleting orders for one person must not affect orders of another person having the same order.
// end::designcons-orders[]

// tag::changingthemes[]
=== Changing Themes

The theme of ContactSails can be changed using the `ChangeThemeCommand`.
Currently, ContactSails supports `dark` and `light` themes.

==== Current Implementation

The `Theme` object in the `model` is used to store the current theme version.

The figure below shows the hierarchy of the `Theme` class.

.UML Diagram showing the `Model` component with the `Theme` class.
image::ThemeClassUMLDiagram.png[width="300" align="center"]

When the `ChangeThemeCommand` is executed, a `ChangeThemeEvent` is raised by `EventsCenter`.

The `handleChangeThemeEvent() method in the `MainWindow`
class subscribes to this particular event and calls the `handleChangeTheme()` FXML controller method. This method changes the theme of the application based on the
theme version it receives as a parameter. This is done by attaching the corresponding `CSS` stylesheet to the `MainWindow` JavaFX scene of the application.

Given below is a high level sequence diagram for the `ChangeThemeCommand`.

.High-Level Sequence Diagram for `ChangeThemeCommand`.
image::HighLevelSequenceDiagramChangeTheme.png[width="500" align="center"]

When the user exits the application, the current theme version will be stored in the `preferences.json` file as shown in the code snippet below.

----
{
  "guiSettings" : {
        // ... guiSettings attributes ...
    },
    "theme" : "dark"
  },
  // ... file management attributes ...
}
----

Storing the theme in the `preferences.json` enables the theme change to be persistent across different application sessions.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storing theme version

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encapsulate the theme version in a `Theme` object.
** Pros: Relevant attributes and methods will be encapsulated in a single class.
** Cons: Higher memory overhead.
* **Alternative 2:** Storing the theme version as a string in guiSettings.
** Pros: Easier to implement, and lesser memory overhead.
** Cons: Methods related to changing themes would have to be written in multiple classes.
// end::changingthemes[]

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

// tag::proposeddataencryption[]
==== Proposed Implementation

The address book will decrypt and encrypt the XML data file every time there is an update that needs to be made to the data
being stored.

The secret key for encryption/decryption will be generated using the `KeyGenerator` class in the `javax.crypto` library.

The actual encryption/decryption will be done using the `org.apache.xml.security` library, specifically the `XMLCipher` class.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Time of encryption of XML data file

---
* **Alternative 1:** Encrypt/decrypt the whole file each time there is an update to what information needs to stored.
** Pros: A new secret key can be used for each encryption/decryption, which would make it more secure against tampering or outsider access.
** Cons: Encryption of data file for every minor change can reduce the performance of the application.
* **Alternative 2:** Encrypt/decrypt the file only after a set time interval.
** Pros: Performance will be improved.
** Cons: Approach might be less secure. Implementation can also be harder.
// end::proposeddataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

// tag::calendarentries[]
=== Calendar and Entry tracking

Entries refer to meetings, deadlines and order deliveries created by users in ContactSails.
Users can create, edit and delete entries.
ContactSails has a calendar interface that displays existing entries for better visualisation of the user's schedule.

==== Current Implementation

ContactSails uses CalendarFX's calendar interface. The `Model` component manages a list of entries, and this list of entries will synchronise with
the calendar's internal list of entries.

===== Calendar Entries
`CalendarEntry` represents an entry created by users.

A `CalendarEntry` is implemented in the following manner:
[source,java]
----
public class CalendarEntry {

    private final String entryTitle;
    private final StartDate startDate;
    private final EndDate endDate;
    private final StartTime startTime;
    private final EndTime endTime;


    // ... CalendarEntry attribute getters and setters ...

}
----

The following is a brief description of the attributes of `CalendarEntry`:

* entryTitle: Represents title of entry.
* startDate: Represents starting date of the entry in DD-MM-YYYY format.
* endDate: Represents ending date of the entry in DD-MM-YYYY format.
* startTime: Represents starting time of the entry in HH:MM format (24-Hour format).
* endTime: Represents ending time of the entry in HH:MM format (24-Hour format).

Entry management is facilitated by `CalendarManager` residing in `ModelManager`.
It supports the adding, removing and editing of `CalendarEntry`(e.g. `addEntry`, `deleteEntry`) and maintains a `UniqueCalendarEntryList` to store `CalendarEntry`.
Ongoing orders of a person will also appear as `CalendarEntry` based on the `DeliveryDate` attribute of the `Order`.

The following diagram shows class diagram of `Model` Component related to `CalendarEntry`.

.Classes related to entry management in `Model` and `Commons`
image::CalendarEntryClassDiagram.png[width="800" align="center"]

In the Figure 22, `ModelManager` contains an instance of `CalendarManager`. `ModelManager` calls the functions in `CalendarManager` to manage `CalendarEntries` stored in it.
`CalendarManager` in turn calls methods in `UniqueCalendarEntryList` to add, remove or edit `CalendarEntries` stored in it.
`CalendarManager` contains an instance of `Calendar` belonging to CalendarFX's library. `Calendar` stores `Entry`, as defined in CalendarFX's library.
`CalendarEntry` is converted to `Entry` before they can be added to `Calendar` via `CalendarUtil` in the `Commons` class.

`Logic` Component contains the commands required to manage user's entries (e.g. `AddEntryCommand`, `DeleteEntryCommand`).

The sequence diagram below shows how adding an entry works:

.Sequence Diagram for adding of an entry into ContactSails
image::AddEntrySD.png[width="800" align="center]

In Figure 23, when a user enters the command to add an entry, `AddEntryCommandParser` is invoked which creates a `CalendarEntry` based on user input. The parser then creates `AddEntryCommand` passing the `CalendarEntry` to it.
When AddEntryCommand is executed, `CalendarEntry` is passed from `AddEntryCommand` to `ModelManager` and to `CalendarManager`, which adds it to `UniqueCalendarEntryList`.
The `CalendarEntry` is then converted to `Entry` to be added to `Calendar` and control is eventually returned to the user.

Storing of `CalendarEvent` data is managed by `CalendarManagerStorage` within `Storage` Component, converting `CalendarEntry` to `XmlAdaptedCalendarEntry` to store in a .xml file.
This file is separate from the one storing `Person` and `Order`.

===== Calendar Interface

`CalendarView` within CalendarFX's library uses the `Calendar` within `CalendarManager` in `Model` to display all entries stored within `Calendar`.
`CalendarPanel` residing in `Ui` component creates an instance of `CalendarView` to manage the display of the calendar.
The panel responds to events related to the calendar, such as changing the viewing format or changing the current date displayed.
Any changes made to `Calendar` in `Model` will automatically be shown via the `CalendarView`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of calendar interface
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Integrate CalendarFX to display entries while all entry data is stored locally.
** Pros: Doing so does not require constant Internet access to manage data of Calendar. CalendarFX can also synchronise with certain calendar applications such as Google Calendar.
As less code is written to implement it, the effort required to maintain or debug is potentially lesser.
** Cons: CalendarFX has many features that are currently not used in ContactSails. Developers who intend to use them need to decide and learn how to implement such features by themselves.
Developers cannot customise the calendar itself to implement features not present in the library or modify existing features.
Bugs present in the library cannot be easily fixed by developers.


* **Alternative 2:** Create a calendar using JavaFX to manage entries.
** Pros: This option offers greater potential for customisation as code is entirely managed by developers.
** Cons: There is greater probability of bugs created as implementation have to be created from scratch.
As compared to using third-party libraries, substantial lines of code has to be written, thus debugging may be harder.
Design of features of the calendar have to be decided by developers themselves, which requires more time and effort to implement the features.
// end::calendarentries[]

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section covers the build automation tools, coverage reporting tools and other tools used in ContactSails.
It also covers the steps required to create new releases and manage dependencies.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, ContactSails depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: +

* Include those libraries in the repo. (this bloats the repo size) +
* Require developers to download those libraries manually. (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution.

[appendix]
== Product Scope

This section states the intended users of ContactSails, the value ContactSails should bring to them and
contributions of every developer in the team in regards to developing ContactSails to meet the proposed value.

*Target user profile*: ContactSails is meant for salespersons from small companies or home-grown businesses with customers from various social media platforms.

A typical user from our target user profile:

* promotes and sells products or services through social media.
* works in a small company or runs his/her own business.
* has limited applications to support their marketing strategies.
* has a need to manage a large number of contacts.
* has many contacts spread across many social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
* has many contacts with volatile details.
* has many contacts that can be grouped together based on type of products purchased by contacts.
* prefer desktop apps over other types.
* can type fast.
* prefers typing over mouse input.
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps.

*Value proposition*: ContactSails serve as the consolidation platform for all contacts from different platforms for
 users to communicate with customers more easily, analyse and apply their marketing strategies more effectively and efficiently.

*Feature Contribution:*

1. *Aadyaa Maddi*
* *Major Feature*: Ability to manage customer orders.
** Orders can be added, edited, and deleted.
** A list of current orders can be viewed.
** Orders can also be marked as ongoing or fulfilled.
* *Minor Feature*: Changing theme of the application.
* *How the above features fit into the product scope:*
** *Major Feature*: For salespersons, this feature will be essential to have as they would want to keep track of what their customers are ordering and what they have ordered already.
If customers have any issues regarding their orders, salespersons will be able to view all the relevant information in a single place.
** *Minor Feature*: As a user, the salesperson would want to customise the application to suit their needs.

2. *Alicia Ho Sor Sian*
* *Major Feature*: Ability to manage entries which are displayed in a calendar.
** Allows users to add, edit or delete entries, which can represent events or deadlines including order deliveries.
** Once set, the event will be displayed in ContactSails' calendar, which shows all incoming events for the current month and after.
** Orders set by users will automatically appear in the calendar without the user having to create an event for it.
* *Minor Feature*: Classifying tags into two categories, groups and preferences.
** Create 2 distinct categories of tags representing groups that a contact belongs to and preferences that a contact has.
** Each category is displayed at a separate location in the Ui.
* *How the above features fit into the product scope:*
** *Major Feature*: The calendar can remind salespersons any impending meetings or deadlines especially order deliveries to save time in planning their next course of action carefully.
It provides a quicker way to manage events compared to using other calendar applications that mainly relies on GUI input.
** *Minor Feature*: Groups can be used to indicate which social media platform does the salesperson use to communicate with a particular contact, while preferences indicates the products and services a contact usually purchases.
Using separate labels for groups and preferences placed at separate locations in the Ui display gives a more organised display of a contact's information, allowing salespersons to derive important information of their contacts quickly.

3. *Ang Jing Zhe*
* *Major Feature*: Addition of person panel to the user interface.
** It allows users to see their contacts' information in a neater and more detailed manner.
** An alternative consideration is to vary the amount of information put up at the panel.
* *Minor Feature*: Adding colours to tags.
** Putting colours to tags so that it looks more user friendly.
* *How the above features fit into the product scope:*
** *Major Feature*: Users can see their contacts' information more clearly and neatly.
** *Minor Feature*: Colours are more eye-catching and help users to identify different tags.

4. *Kevin Yeong Yu Heng*
* *Major Feature*: Ability to import and export contacts from and to other formats.
** Allows user to export contacts to a local contact files and import contacts from local contact files.
** The exported file can integrate in the users' workflow which might include external manipulation of the data such as printing a hardcopy of the contact list or using it in an external spreadsheet software.
* *Minor Feature*: Ability to generate and display a list of relevant fields of multiple contacts.
** Ability to only show certain fields associated to contacts selected by filters.
** Displays the information in a list rather and excludes other information which is not needed by the user.
* *How the above features fit into the product scope:*
** *Major Feature*: The export and import facility enables users to use the data from ContactSails solely as an addressbook, but gives them the option to more easily integrate it to their current application processes which might allow them to be more efficient in their work.
